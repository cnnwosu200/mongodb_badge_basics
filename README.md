## Short Written Responses

1. Relational databases, like MySQL, use a fixed layout with tables and rows, while non-relational/document databases, like MongoDB, store data in flexible documents (such as JSON) without a strict structure.  Because of its flexibility, MongoDB can easily handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making it great for applications that are constantly changing. Since related data can be stored directly in documents, this flexibility reduces the need for complex JOIN operations, improving read performance. Also, MongoDB provides some level of consistency for scalability and performance.

2. MongoDB would be perfect for maintaining electronic health records (EHR) in a healthcare setting. A patient's data can include a wide range of information, such as allergies, medications, procedures, lab results, and imaging studies, each with different attributes. MongoDB's document format naturally supports these differences. Its flexible structure allows it to store and quickly access many kinds of medical records without having to rearrange data as often as a relational database would have to merge several normalized tables. For healthcare systems managing different and dynamic patient data, this flexibility is essential.
